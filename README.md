# Space-Crusader

## Hello!
This is a school project and the first game I've ever fully written, using allegro library.
Because of the project requirements I had to restrain myself from using many of C++ features, but I still managed to make a game.
It's a very basic top-view shooter- the levels are short, there's 3 of them, the save function is a joke etc.
About the code- it's not good too, but like I said before- everyone started somewhere.

### How to compile it?
There's a makefile, so you just need to download allegro5 (don't worry, it's a free library) and put in in project's root. I still haven't tested it on linux, but there shouldn't be any issues.
