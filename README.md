# Space-Crusader

Hello!
This is a school project and the first game I've written, using allegro library.
Because of the project requirements I had to restrain myself from using many of C++ functions, but I still managed to make a game.
It's a very basic top-view shooter- the levels are short, there's 3 of them, the save function is a joke etc.
About the code- it's not good too, but like I said before- everyone started somewhere.
I've also included the allegro library, which I obviously didn't write.
