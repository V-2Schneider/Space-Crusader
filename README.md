# Space-Crusader

## Hello!
This is a school project and the first game I've written, using allegro library.
Because of the project requirements I had to restrain myself from using many of C++ functions, but I still managed to make a game.
It's a very basic top-view shooter- the levels are short, there's 3 of them, the save function is a joke etc.
About the code- it's not good too, but like I said before- everyone started somewhere.

## 2019 Update!
I've cleaned up this repo a bit, removed the library and many other unnecessary files!

Graphics are removed now too, but I'll probably bring them back someday, after other cleanup

### Some Problems with the repo
Right now there are some files missing, not to mention that there were still a lot of files that shouldn't even be here! How absurd!
